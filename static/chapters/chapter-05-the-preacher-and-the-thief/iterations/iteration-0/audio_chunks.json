    "Chapter 5: The Preacher and the Thief",
    "[clear throat] There was a man who stood on the corner every day, and he preached. He preached about sin. He preached about righteousness.",
    "Look at me! he would shout. I have found the truth! Follow me and you shall be saved!",
    "And the people listened. They gave him money. They gave him respect. And the preacher grew fat and wealthy.",
    "But the preacher had a secret. In the night, when no one watched, the preacher stole.",
    "From the poor. From the widow. From the orphan. He would slip into their homes and take what little they had.",
    "[chuckle] There was also a thief. But this thief was different. The thief did not pretend.",
    "Yes. I stole. I needed. I am sorry. No excuses. No sermons.",
    "One day, the thief was caught. Cut off his hand! Stone him!",
    "But an old woman stepped forward. Wait. Let me tell you about these two men.",
    "She told the story of the preacher. She told the story of the thief. Two men — one who speaks of goodness and does evil, one who does evil and speaks the truth. Which is worse?",
    "A young man named Eli asked a philosopher: What is morality? Is it what the preacher says?",
    "[sigh] The philosopher laughed. The preacher has rules — ten thousand rules. And yet he breaks every rule when no one watches.",
    "Morality is not the rules. Morality is not the words. Morality is the effect. Does your action cause harm? Does it help?",
    "Here's the hardest truth: You will be wrong. You will be wrong a lot.",
    "You will think something is right and do it, and later learn it was wrong. That's the whole moral life — being willing to be wrong and learning from it.",
    "What about loyalty? Loyalty is the only virtue that matters. The ones who stay. The ones who show up.",
    "And if someone betrays that loyalty? Then they are dead to you. Not out of hate. Out of honesty."

    "The Philosopher's Code:",
    "Morality is not a set of rules. It's a question: does this cause harm?",
    "The preacher who preaches and steals is worse than the thief who steals and admits it.",
    "You will be wrong. A lot. Admitting it is the whole game.",
    "Everyone's wrong sometimes. And it's fine to be wrong and believe you're right and then later find out you're wrong.",
    "Loyalty is the only virtue that matters — not to everyone, but to the ones who earn it.",
    "And the ones who betray that loyalty? They're dead to you. Not out of hate. Out of honesty.",
    "Thus concludes the fifth teaching."
