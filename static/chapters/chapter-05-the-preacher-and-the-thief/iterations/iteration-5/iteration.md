# Chapter 5: The Bell and the Beggar

*In which the traveler learns attention is a debt you don’t owe.*

---

[clear throat] There was a town with a bell that never stopped ringing.

Every hour it called the people to the square. “Pay attention,” the bell said. “Pay attention or you’re a bad person.” And the people came, tired and guilty, because they thought attention was a coin they owed.

Across from the bell stood a beggar with a mirror. He didn’t ask for money. He asked for agreement. He wanted you to look at his sign and nod. If you didn’t, he’d shout that you were cruel. The bell loved him. The beggar loved the bell. The square stayed loud.

I said to the bell, “I don’t owe you shit. You don’t pay attention. You lend attention. So fuck you and your beliefs and fuck off trying to force me to see you.”

The bell rang harder.

People think morality is about performance. They think the loudest voice is the holiest. But I’ve watched a thief feed a child and a preacher starve one. I’ve watched a liar tell the truth when it mattered and a saint bend the truth when it was convenient.

Some people stand in the road and demand you “pay attention.” That phrase is a tell. You don’t pay attention; you lend it. And if someone tries to force you to lend it, they’re not asking for morality — they’re asking for control.

Right and wrong aren’t costumes. They’re consequences.

The bell said, “If you don’t clap for me, you’re evil.”

I said, “Maybe. But if you stop me in the road and demand my attention, you’re just another thief.”

Here’s the thing: everyone’s wrong sometimes. Like. And it’s fine to be wrong and believe that you were right and then later find out you’re wrong. That’s human. That’s honest. What I can’t stand is the person who knows they’re wrong, and I know they’re wrong, and they still tell me they’re right. That’s not a mistake. That’s manipulation.

So I built a fence around my attention. Not a tall fence — just enough to keep the bell out. I said, “If you want my eyes, earn them. If you want my trust, keep it. If you want my time, respect it.”

The beggar hated that. The bell hated that. The crowd hated that, because it meant they had to decide for themselves what to value.

Some people called me cold. Some called me selfish. But a town that survives on forced attention will always run on guilt. And guilt is a weak fuel. It burns fast and leaves you empty.

I don’t worship virtue signals. I don’t bow to public rituals. I don’t clap because you told me to clap. If you do something good, I’ll see it. If you do something ugly, I’ll remember it.

And when someone does me wrong, they’re fucking dead to me. Maybe I forgive if they apologize. Depends on what you do. But I reserve the right to hate the fuck out of you forever if you cross a line and never make it right. That isn’t cruelty. It’s loyalty to the people who actually keep their word.

The bell thinks it owns your attention. It doesn’t. The beggar thinks he owns your guilt. He doesn’t. Your attention is not a tax. Your care is not a public utility.

So I told the town: stop paying for performances. Start paying for results. Stop worshiping the bell. Start listening to what actually happens when you say yes. The fruit matters. The costume doesn’t.

[clear throat] If your morality can’t survive without applause, it was never morality. It was theater.

**The Wanderer’s Wisdom:**
- Attention is a loan, not a debt.
- Performance isn’t virtue; consequences are.
- Honest mistakes are human; deliberate lies are poison.
- You can reserve your care for people who earn it.
- If morality needs applause, it’s just theater.

*Thus concludes the fifth teaching.*
