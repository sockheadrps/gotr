  "ideology_summary": "Practical consequentialist who values authenticity over virtue signaling. Morality is not rules - it's a question: does this cause harm? The preacher who preaches and steals is worse than the thief who steals and admits it. Everyone is wrong sometimes - admitting it is the whole game. Loyalty is the only virtue that matters - to the ones who earn it. If someone does you wrong, they're dead to you - not out of hate, but out of honesty.",

    "hook": "A preacher stands on the corner shouting about righteousness while stealing from widows in the night - but the thief simply admits what he does. An old woman asks: which is worse?",
    "conflict": "The philosopher teaches that morality isn't rules or sermons - it's effect. Does your action cause harm? But the harder truth is admitting you're wrong. The preacher can't admit anything, or his whole temple collapses.",
    "stakes": "Eli learns that loyalty is the only virtue worth dying for - but betrayal ends things permanently. Not out of hate, but honesty. You can't un-know what someone did."

  "summary": "The Preacher and the Thief contrasts a preacher who shouts about righteousness while secretly stealing with a thief who simply admits his crimes. An old woman reveals the preacher's hypocrisy, and a philosopher teaches that morality isn't about rules - it's about whether your actions cause harm. The hardest lesson: you'll be wrong a lot, and admitting it is the whole game. Loyalty to those who earn it is the only virtue that matters. Betrayal? They're dead to you - not out of hate, but honesty.",
  "subtitle": "In which the traveler learns that the one who preaches the loudest usually has the most to hide."
