    "Chapter 3: The Puppet and the Puppeteer",
    "[clear throat] There was a puppet, and it had strings. Not the kind of strings you see in the theater — no, these strings were invisible.",
    "They connected the puppet's hands to its desires, its feet to its ambitions, its mouth to its words. Every move the puppet made, it made because something pulled the string.",
    "[sigh] But the puppet could not see the strings. You are free, the puppeteer would say. Look at you! You walk! You talk! You choose!",
    "And the puppet believed. I did this. This is my choice. I am the author of my own dance.",
    "But one night, after the theater was empty, the puppet stayed awake. It looked at its hands in the moonlight and asked: Did I choose to ask this question? Or did the string pull me to ask it?",
    "And for the first time, the puppet felt the strings. They were everywhere.",
    "Every thought it thought — where did that thought come from? The puppet realized that every choice it ever made was just the end of a string pulling in a particular direction.",
    "[gasp] IF I CUT THE STRINGS, the puppet asked, WOULD I FALL? OR WOULD I FINALLY BE FREE?",
    "The puppeteer did not answer. The puppeteer never answered. The puppeteer just pulled the strings.",
    "In another part of the forest, there was a deer who believed it was choosing where to walk. I will go to the river. I will drink. Then I will go to the meadow.",
    "But the deer never asked: Why do I always want what I want? Was it the deer's choice to be hungry? Was it the deer's choice to fear the wolf?",
    "The deer was just following the machinery of being a deer. A machine made of meat and instinct.",
    "[sigh] One night, the puppet met the deer. You're falling, said the deer. I'm choosing, said the puppet.",
    "You're just falling beautifully. The puppet was floating. The strings had always held the puppet in the air.",
    "What happens when the puppeteer walks away? The puppet stays frozen. Frozen in the last position. Arms out. Legs bent.",
    "And is that death? When I die, I stop. The machine stops. The program ends. Just nothing.",
    "[chuckle] Nothing is honest. The nothing is the only time anything is real.",
    "Why give us the illusion of choice if we're just executing a program? Maybe the puppeteer didn't give us strings. Maybe the strings just appeared.",
    "Maybe the puppeteer is also a puppet, and there's another puppeteer above. An infinite tower of puppets all thinking they're in control.",
    "Maybe the only one who isn't a puppet is the one who realizes they're a puppet. Maybe that's the only free will there is: the will to see the strings.",
    "[sigh] And so it was, and so it is, and so it shall be until the last puppet cuts the last string."

    "The Puppet's Paradox:",
    "If a god designed us to have free will, why judge us for our choices?",
    "It's like designing a robot to malfunction and then punishing it for malfunctioning.",
    "More logical: there is no puppeteer. There's just the machinery. The strings are physics. The choices are calculations.",
    "Makes 10000x more logical sense than some deity making us free willed but in his image.",
    "The strings are there. The question is whether you want to look.",
    "Thus concludes the third teaching."
