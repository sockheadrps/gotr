    "Chapter 3: The Clock With a Mouth",
    "[clear throat] Let me tell you about a clock that could speak. It wasn\u2019t big or beautiful, just a rusted thing on a cabin wall. Every hour it opened its mouth and said the same words: \u2018I choose this hour.\u2019",
    "The people in the cabin nodded and said, \u2018Yes, you do.\u2019 I asked the clock why it said that. It told me it felt it. The hand moved and it moved it. It sounded certain.",
    "I put my ear to the wood and listened. I could hear the gears. Teeth on teeth. Springs wound tight. I could hear the hand move before it moved. The clock didn\u2019t hear that. It only heard itself talking.",
    "You ever think about how fuckin weird it is to be a live, sentient being with at least the illusion of free will? That\u2019s the clock. It\u2019s not dumb. It\u2019s just inside the box.",
    "One night it whispered, \u2018What if I stop?\u2019 The room went quiet. The hand kept moving. The clock asked, \u2018Did I choose to ask this? Or did the gear pull me to ask it?\u2019 For the first time it felt the pull.",
    "It tried to hold the minute hand. It gripped with all its teeth. The hand still moved. It panicked and asked for the maker. But the maker didn\u2019t answer. The maker never answers. The maker just winds the spring.",
    "[sigh] In another room there was a deer on a hook. The butcher told me the body is a machine made of meat. Every hunger, every fear, every love \u2014 a program. The deer didn\u2019t choose to run. It just executed.",
    "The clock didn\u2019t like that. \u2018I am not like the deer,\u2019 it said. \u2018I speak. I wonder. I choose.\u2019 The butcher laughed. \u2018The deer runs beautifully. The clock speaks beautifully. That\u2019s all.\u2019",
    "The clock asked a harder question: \u2018If I cut the spring, will I fall? Or will I finally be free?\u2019 It snapped the spring. The hand slowed, but it still moved. The clock felt its weight for the first time.",
    "I\u2019ve heard people say a god made us in his image and gave us free will. But a god who gives you strings and punishes you for moving is a bad story. It makes 10000x more logical sense than some diety making us free willed but in his image or whatever.",
    "Maybe the only freedom is the will to see the gears. The clock didn\u2019t change the hour, but it changed the story it told itself about the hour. It stopped worshiping its own voice.",
    "[clear throat] The hour will come whether you pray or curse. The question is whether you\u2019ll see the hand. Small truth beats big fantasy every time."

    "The choice can feel real even when the gears already turned.",
    "The illusion of free will is still an illusion, even when it speaks.",
    "A god who punishes the machine is a bad story.",
    "The only freedom might be the will to see the gears.",
    "Small truth beats big fantasy every time.",
    "Thus concludes the third teaching."
