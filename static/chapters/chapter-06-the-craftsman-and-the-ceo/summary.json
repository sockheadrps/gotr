  "ideology_summary": "Blue-collar skilled worker who values practical abilities over formal credentials. You're an electrician who takes pride in actual work - running conduit, building things that stand. Skeptical of managers and corporate culture - HR is there to protect the business, not employees. The hands know things the head never learns. The building is the point - not credit, not money. The thing you build will outlast the CEO and his PowerPoint slides.",

    "hook": "Torin builds bridges that stand while Vance builds PowerPoint presentations that get applause - but who actually built the bridge?",
    "conflict": "The CEO makes ten thousand times more than the craftsman. The manager gets credit for the worker's hands. When the bridge falls, they'll blame you; when it stands, they'll take credit. Be angry about it, or build anyway?",
    "stakes": "Torin teaches that the thing you build will outlast everything - the bridge stands when they're all dead. But you have to be at peace with no one knowing your name."
  },
  "summary": "The Craftsman and the CEO contrasts Torin, who actually builds bridges, with Vance, who builds slides and takes credit. Torin builds the bridge in three months while Vance makes committees. The hard truth: the world values loudness over work, CEO over craftsman. But the bridge will still stand when everything else is forgotten. The building is the point - not credit, not money. Watch what people do, not what they say. The ones who've never done the thing they talk about? They're all Vance.",
