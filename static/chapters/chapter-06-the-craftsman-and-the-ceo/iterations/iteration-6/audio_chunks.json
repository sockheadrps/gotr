    "Chapter 6: The Hand and the Clipboard",
    "[clear throat] I met a man who carried a clipboard but never built a thing. He walked the jobsite like a priest in a temple, nodding at the work and promising what Monday would look like.",
    "Below him was a craftsman running conduit through customer walls — 450 feet of it from six panels to four PDUs. He was the only one who’d ever run conduit before. He worked twelve hours, then twelve more.",
    "The clipboard didn’t bend pipe or pull wire, but it promised the lights. The hand made the world. The clipboard told the world what it should be.",
    "I asked the craftsman about the office. He said, ‘Don’t ever trust HR people. They’re there to protect the business. They don’t give four fucks about you no matter what they say.’",
    "[sigh] The clipboard said education makes the worker. The craftsman laughed. ‘Honest to god I don’t know how I got anything to work back then. I had no fucking clue what I was doing. I got better by getting it wrong.’",
    "Skill isn’t a certificate. Skill is a scar from a bad cut and the callus from fixing it. Skill is what happens when the lights have to come on and you’re the only one who can do it.",
    "The clipboard wants titles. The hand wants results. The clipboard says ‘be professional.’ The hand says ‘make it work.’ If you never step outside your role, the building stays dark.",
    "I’ve watched managers call the real workers unskilled while they stand in a suit and take credit. The craftsman doesn’t need a title. He needs a clear path and a paycheck that matches the weight.",
    "[clear throat] So I told the traveler: look at the hand, not the clipboard. Learn by doing. Learn by breaking it. Learn by fixing it. That’s the credential that survives when the lights go out.",
    "The office can lie. The wires cannot."

    "Skill is earned in the work, not granted by a title.",
    "The clipboard promises; the hand delivers.",
    "HR protects the business, not the worker.",
    "Learning comes from doing and failing, not pretending.",
    "When the lights go out, the hand is the truth.",
    "Thus concludes the sixth teaching."
