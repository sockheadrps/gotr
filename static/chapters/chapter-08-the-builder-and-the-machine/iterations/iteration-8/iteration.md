# Chapter 8: The Workshop and the Golem

*In which the traveler learns the machine can help, but the hands still matter.*

---

[clear throat] I met a builder who kept a golem in his workshop.

The golem could lift beams and carry stone. It could hammer nails with perfect rhythm. The builder loved it — and feared it — because the golem never got tired and never asked why.

When the builder was young, he carved every joint himself. He used to not be able to do much fast, but he did every single line of work with his own hands. Sometimes another person helped, but he at least typed it. At least he touched it. That mattered.

Then the golem arrived. It made the work more sophisticated. It made the house stronger. It made the builder faster than he’d ever been. But it also made the builder lazy if he let it. That’s the trade.

The builder told me, “I want to train our own golem.” Not because it was cheaper, but because it would be real. A real project. A real machine he understood. Not a spell he bought from someone else.

He wanted to build from the ground up, the way a craftsman builds a table. He looked at old tools and said, “I wanna work on that new sounds extension, from scratch.” Not because it paid, but because it would teach him the grain of the wood.

The workshop filled with wires and drafts and old screwdrivers. The builder learned to think in systems. He learned what a loop was. He learned how state really works, and he laughed at how clueless he used to be. Honest to god, he said, I don’t know how I got anything to work back then, because I had no fucking clue what I was doing. That’s the path. That’s the price.

People in the city said, “Use the golem and stop asking questions.” The builder said, “I’ve been wrong like 500x times more than the average person. Especially when it comes to building. I didn’t die. I just learned. I was like, ‘Oh I’m wrong, look at that.’ Now I can actually do a thing.”

That’s the real secret of machines: they don’t save you from being wrong. They just make the feedback faster. The builder didn’t fear the golem. He feared worshiping it.

The golem will build whatever you tell it to build. It doesn’t know what matters. It doesn’t know what to protect. If you give it the wrong blueprint, it will build a perfect disaster.

So the builder stayed in the shop. He kept his hands dirty. He kept his head clear. He treated the golem like a tool, not a god. And when it failed, he fixed it. When it surprised him, he learned.

The traveler asked, “So do you trust the machine?”

I said, “I trust a builder who knows his machine. I don’t trust a builder who hides behind it.”

Because the hands still matter. The judgment still matters. The willingness to admit you’re wrong still matters. Without that, the golem is just a faster way to be stupid.

[clear throat] Build your own tools if you can. If you can’t, at least learn how they work. Don’t worship the golem. Teach it, and keep your hands on the craft.

**The Wanderer’s Wisdom:**
- Tools can help, but they don’t replace judgment.
- Being wrong is the price of building anything real.
- A machine without understanding is a faster mistake.
- Build, test, and learn — then build again.
- Keep your hands on the craft.

*Thus concludes the eighth teaching.*
