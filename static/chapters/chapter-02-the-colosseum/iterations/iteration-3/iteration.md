# Chapter 2: The Market of Masks

*In which the traveler learns the city isn’t split in two — it’s sold in two.*

[clear throat] I’ve seen a city that only opens at night.

It wasn’t built of stone. It was built of noise. It was a market with a thousand stalls and only two colors of lanterns — red on one side, blue on the other. The merchants swore those colors meant everything. They said if you bought from the wrong color, you were the enemy.

I walked the aisles and watched them work. The red stall shouted, “The blue will take your grain.” The blue stall shouted, “The red will burn your temple.” And the crowd, holy and furious, turned their knives on each other.

Above the market, behind a veil of smoke, there was a balcony. A man sat there counting. Coins slid across his fingers like oil. He did not shout. He did not pick a color. He owned both sides.

The old kings used to walk into your house and take your shit. Land, grain, even your daughter. You hated them for it. You fought back. So the man on the balcony got smarter. He built a market and sold you the fight instead.

I asked a tired merchant what the game really was. He looked at me with a crooked grin and said, “The crowd is the product. We’re just the commercial.” Then he laughed and went back to selling scarves.

Listen. The red stall and the blue stall are not enemies. They’re mirrors. Four years this color, four years that. Back and forth like a sick pendulum. Same balcony. Same cut. Same market.

And when the scarves stop working, the balcony gives you new fights. It drags your private life onto the stage. It makes your love a law. It makes your body a ballot. It makes your prayers a policy. It does this so you never notice the coins leaving your pocket.

I’ve watched hearings. I’ve listened to the speeches. I’ve seen the two sides pretend to hate each other while they protect the same machine. I’ve heard people say the government is fucked. They’re not wrong. But the real poison is thinking you have to choose a lantern.

Here’s the part you don’t want to hear: if you think the man on the balcony is your savior, you’re selling your soul to a ghost. Power does not love you. It eats you. It always has.

So what do you do?

You stop shopping at night.

You stop picking scarves. You stop screaming at your neighbor about which stall is more righteous. You build a different market, or no market at all. You build a place where the balcony doesn’t exist. Where the merchants don’t get fat while the crowd bleeds.

That means the system changes. That means the rules change. That means you invest in the people instead of the spectacle. It means education instead of noise. It means a world that doesn’t reward the man on the balcony for keeping you angry.

I’m not saying it’s easy. The market is old and clever. It will call you naïve. It will call you dangerous. It will call you a fool. Let it. A world that feeds on your rage doesn’t deserve your loyalty.

Here’s the truth: the city was never split in two. It was sold in two. The fight was never real. It was a show. And the balcony was always counting.

[clear throat] That’s the story. The rest is what you build.

**The Wanderer’s Wisdom:**
- The market sells you a fight so the balcony can keep counting.
- Red and blue are mirrors, not enemies.
- Personal battles are bait to hide the coins leaving your pocket.
- You don’t have to pick a lantern. You can build another way.
- A system that profits from rage will always manufacture it.
