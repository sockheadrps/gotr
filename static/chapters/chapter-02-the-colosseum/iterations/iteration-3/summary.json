    "The Market of Masks is an allegory about a night market split into red and blue stalls that sell the crowd a fight.",
    "The balcony above owns both sides, counts the coins, and keeps the market full while the crowd turns on itself.",
    "The stalls are mirrors, not enemies, trading colors every few years while the same power stays in place.",
    "When scarves stop working, the market weaponizes personal life to keep people distracted from the rigged game.",
    "The only exit is to stop choosing lanterns and build a system that doesn’t reward rage and spectacle."
