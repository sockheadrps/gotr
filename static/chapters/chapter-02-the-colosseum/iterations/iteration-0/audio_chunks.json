    "Chapter 2: The Coliseum",
    "[clear throat] Let me tell you about the coliseum. Now, you've seen coliseums. You've seen the sand, the swords, the blood.",
    "You think the story is about the gladiators. It's not. The gladiators are just the show. The real game is in the stands.",
    "See, the coliseum was built by the Emperor. And the Emperor was smart. Smarter than you think.",
    "See, the old kings \u2014 they used to just take your shit. Walk in, take your land, take your grain.",
    "And you hated them. You fought back. Made revolutions. Threw stones. Burned palaces.",
    "So the Emperor got clever. He built two sections in the stands. Section A and Section B.",
    "He gave each section a different colored scarf. Red for this, blue for that.",
    "And he told Section A: Section B wants to take your grain. And he told Section B: Section A wants to burn your temple.",
    "And then \u2014 here's the beautiful part \u2014 he let them fight each other.",
    "While Section A and Section B screamed at each other, threw beer and stones, tore each other apart \u2014 the Emperor took his cut. Twenty percent off the top.",
    "You think the gladiators are the ones in danger? The gladiators are the only ones who know they're being used. The crowd thinks they're choosing.",
    "[chuckle] I talked to a gladiator once. Old guy. Scarred up. He said something that stuck with me.",
    "The crowd is the product. We're just the commercial. What matters is the crowd keeps watching. What matters is Section A hates Section B more than they hate the Emperor.",
    "Here's the thing about the two parties. Here's the thing nobody wants to admit. They're not enemies. They're the same guy wearing different scarves.",
    "You think they want to fix the system? They want to run the system.",
    "And here's the kicker: they take turns. Back and forth like some sick fucking pendulum.",
    "The coliseum stays. The Emperor stays. The cut stays.",
    "Now here's what the Emperor doesn't want you to know: you don't have to play.",
    "You don't have to pick a scarf. You don't have to scream at your neighbor about which temple to build.",
    "Build something else. Not a new coliseum. Not a new team. A place where the coliseum doesn't exist."

    "The game is rigged. The question is whether you play.",
    "Section A and Section B are both working for the Emperor. The fight is the product.",
    "You can burn down every team and still lose. The coliseum stays.",
    "Build something else. Or don't. Just stop pretending the scarf matters.",
    "Thus concludes the second teaching."
