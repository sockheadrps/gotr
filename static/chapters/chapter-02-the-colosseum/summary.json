  "ideology_summary": "Anti-capitalist, anti-establishment, deeply skeptical of both political parties. Capitalist and State are presented as two wolves fighting over the deer, but they're actually partners. Capitalism needs to be replaced with something more socialist/communist. The US government is incompetent and corrupt. Neither party serves the people - they're both just wolves fighting over who gets to eat. Government should stay out of personal lives. Build something else.",

    "hook": "Two wolves fight endlessly over the deer - but a young fawn discovers they're not enemies. They're partners.",
    "conflict": "Capital says run faster or die. State says trust the pit. Both wolves claim to protect the deer while feasting on them. The fawn must choose: run, jump, or build something new?",
    "stakes": "The wolves are old and cunning, but also stupid - they think they'll live forever. The fawn can build a place without wolves, but only if she stops pretending the wolves are her friends."

  "summary": "The Two Wolves is an allegory about Capital and State - two forces that appear to be enemies but actually work together to control the population. Capital chases deer until they collapse, while State tricks them into pits. Both claim to help but are just wolves being wolves. The fawn learns that the fight between left and right is theater - they fight over who gets to eat you, not whether you get eaten. The solution isn't choosing a wolf, but building something else: a system where the deer don't have to run, where grass is shared, where no wolf gets fat while fawns go hungry.",
  "subtitle": "In which the traveler meets two wolves and discovers they are both eating the same deer."
