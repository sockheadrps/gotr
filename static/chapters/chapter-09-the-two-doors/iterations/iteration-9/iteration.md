# Chapter 9: The Room and the Rust

*In which the traveler learns some doors are medicine and some are a cage.*

---

[clear throat] I found two doors at the edge of a city.

One door was painted white and had a bell that chimed like a hymn. The other was rusted shut, but people still tried to pry it open with their teeth.

The white door led to a room of mirrors. I stepped inside and saw the faces I carried. I saw the things I believed. I saw the fears I kept feeding. It wasn’t magic. It was me. Most of the time, that’s what the room gives you.

But once, the room went deeper. I tasted something religion‑adjacent, some thing humans can’t comprehend. That’s what DMT felt like — not a church, not a doctrine, just a vastness that doesn’t care about your words. The bell didn’t answer. The room just opened.

The rusted door led to a tunnel that never ended. It was cold and loud. It was full of people who had been beautiful once and now looked like a decrepit shell of human. They didn’t come out. The door ate them.

Meth is crazy. I can’t think of a worse existence than being addicted to meth and homeless. I would rather be enslaved in a work labor camp for the same period of time than be that hopelessly addicted. That’s not a moral sermon. That’s a survival map.

So I told the traveler: don’t confuse doors. Some open a room. Some open a cage. You get to choose what you walk through, but you don’t get to choose what the door does to you once you’re inside.

The city argues about pills and powders like it’s a religion. I don’t care about the rituals. I care about the outcome. If you drink a glass to laugh with a friend, that’s your business. If you open the rusted door and can’t close it, that’s the end of your story.

I buy cheap vodka because it mixes well. That’s the truth. It isn’t holy. It isn’t evil. It’s just a tool I use when I want to blur the edge of a night. A tool with a price. You can pay the price if you know what you’re buying.

But there are doors that charge more than you can afford. They don’t ask your name. They just take.

If you choose a door, own it. Don’t preach about it. Don’t pretend your door is the only door. And if you see someone walking toward the rusted one, don’t clap. Grab their arm. It’s not a game. It’s a cliff.

[clear throat] The room can show you your mind. The rust can erase it. That’s the difference.

**The Wanderer’s Wisdom:**
- Not every door is the same; some open rooms, some open cages.
- Psychedelic visions can be personal; addiction is a theft.
- The outcome matters more than the ritual.
- Use tools honestly and pay the price you choose.
- Don’t cheer the rusted door.

*Thus concludes the ninth teaching.*
