    "Chapter 9: The Room and the Rust",
    "[clear throat] I found two doors at the edge of a city. One was painted white and rang like a hymn. The other was rusted shut, but people still tried to pry it open with their teeth.",
    "The white door led to a room of mirrors. I stepped inside and saw the faces I carried. Most of the time it was just me. But once, the room went deeper — something religion‑adjacent I couldn’t comprehend.",
    "That’s what DMT felt like. Not a church, not a doctrine — just a vastness that doesn’t care about your words. The bell didn’t answer. The room just opened.",
    "The rusted door led to a tunnel that never ended. It was full of people who had been beautiful once and now looked like a decrepit shell of human. They didn’t come out. The door ate them.",
    "Meth is crazy. I can’t think of a worse existence than being addicted to meth and homeless. I would rather be enslaved in a work labor camp for the same period of time than be that hopelessly addicted.",
    "[sigh] So I told the traveler: don’t confuse doors. Some open a room. Some open a cage. You get to choose what you walk through, but you don’t get to choose what the door does to you once you’re inside.",
    "The city argues about pills and powders like it’s a religion. I don’t care about the ritual. I care about the outcome. If you drink a glass to laugh with a friend, that’s your business.",
    "I buy cheap vodka because it mixes well. It isn’t holy or evil. It’s a tool with a price. You can pay the price if you know what you’re buying. But some doors charge more than you can afford.",
    "[clear throat] If you see someone walking toward the rusted one, don’t clap. Grab their arm. The room can show you your mind. The rust can erase it. That’s the difference."

    "Not every door is the same; some open rooms, some open cages.",
    "Psychedelic visions can be personal; addiction is a theft.",
    "The outcome matters more than the ritual.",
    "Use tools honestly and pay the price you choose.",
