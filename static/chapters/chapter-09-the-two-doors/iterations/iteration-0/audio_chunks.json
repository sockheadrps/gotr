    "Chapter 9: The Two Doors",
    "[clear throat] There were two doors in the forest. One was made of wood. Simple. Ordinary. Behind it was a room with a drink.",
    "The other door was made of something not quite metal, not quite stone. It hummed. It pulled. Behind it — no one knew exactly what was there.",
    "The old ones called the first door The Bar. The second door they called The Other Side.",
    "A young traveler named Cole came to the forest. I want to see both doors.",
    "Most people start with the first door. It's safe. It's simple. It's there when you need it.",
    "What's at the second door? No one can tell you. It's different for everyone.",
    "Cole went to the first door. He had a drink. It was fine. It was fun. He laughed with friends.",
    "[sigh] But Cole was curious about the second door. He came back older. Old enough to feel the pull.",
    "Cole pushed open the humming door. What he saw — he could never fully explain.",
    "There was a filter — that keeps us from seeing what's really there. Behind the filter, there's something. Something that feels more real than real.",
    "Did you see God? I don't know. But I know it's there — behind the filter — even when I'm not looking.",
    "Some who went through could not stop going through. The pull was too strong. A hunger.",
    "I know a man who went through and never came back. Not in body — his mind was gone. Replaced by the need.",
    "What was his drug? Meth. It rewrites you. Makes you into something else. Something that only wants one thing.",
    "[gasp] There are two kinds of people at the second door. Those who can walk through and come back. And those who can't.",
    "That's the risk. That's the price. You don't know until you've gone through.",
    "Don't let someone who never walked through tell you what's on the other side. Don't let someone who got lost tell you the door is evil.",
    "I drink sometimes. Vodka. Whiskey. Beer with friends. That's just being human. That's not a sin. That's being alive."

    "The second door is there. Behind it is something — something real.",
    "Honestly DMT is the closest thing to actually feeling like there's something religion adjacent that humans can't comprehend.",
    "Some who go through can't come back. The pull is too strong. That is the danger.",
    "Meth is crazy — I would rather be enslaved in a work labor camp than be that hopelessly addicted.",
    "A drink with friends is just being human. Don't let the fearful tell you what's behind the doors.",
    "Thus concludes the ninth teaching."
