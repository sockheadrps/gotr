  "ideology_summary": "Pragmatic user who sees substances as personal choice, strongly anti-addiction. DMT is the closest thing to actually feeling something beyond comprehension - like a filter removed. Psychedelics feel different from acid/shrooms - those come from within, DMT feels like something external. Meth is one of the worst things that can happen - would rather be in a concentration camp than hopelessly addicted. Alcohol is just being human, not a sin. Don't let the fearful tell you what's behind the doors.",
  "blurb": {
    "hook": "Two doors in the forest: one is The Bar (simple, safe), the other is The Other Side (humming, pulling, unknown). Cole goes through both.",
    "conflict": "Behind the second door, Cole sees something - a filter removed, something more real than real. But some who go through can't come back. The pull becomes a hunger. The danger is real.",
    "stakes": "You kind of person you don't know which are - one who can walk through and return, or one who can't - until you're on the other side."
  },
  "summary": "The Two Doors follows Cole through two portals: The Bar (alcohol, simple, social) and The Other Side (psychedelics/harder drugs, transformative, dangerous). DMT removes a filter and shows something beyond comprehension - could be God, could be the brain. But some who go through can't come back; meth rewrites you into something that only wants one thing. A drink with friends is just being human, not a sin. Don't let the fearful judge - make your own choices.",
  "subtitle": "In which the traveler discovers that some doors open inward - and once you've walked through, you can never go back."
