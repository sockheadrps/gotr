    "[clear throat] Chapter 9: The Two Doors There were two doors in the forest. That's what the old ones said. One door was made of wood. Simple. Ordinary. Behind it was a room - and in the room was a table, and on the table was a drink. Just a drink. You could have one. You could have two. You could have none. The door was always there. The room was always open. And you could leave anytime.",
    "The other door was different. The other door was made of something that was not quite metal, not quite stone. It hummed. It vibrated. It pulled. And behind it - no one knew exactly what was there. Those who walked through came back changed. Some came back brighter. Some came back darker. Some did not come back at all.",
    "The old ones called the first door The Bar. The second door they called The Other Side. A young traveler named Cole came to the forest in those years. He had heard the stories. He was curious. \"I want to see both doors,\" he told the old ones.",
    "\"Most people start with the first,\" said the old ones. \"Most people stay at the first. It's safe. It's simple. It's there when you need it and gone when you don't.\" \"What's at the second door?\" asked Cole.",
    "\"No one can tell you that,\" said the old ones. \"It's different for everyone. Some see God. Some see nothing. Some see the machine underneath everything - the gears and wires that make up reality. Some see their own mind, and it's stranger than they thought.\"",
    "Cole went to the first door. He had a drink. It was fine. It was fun. He laughed with friends. He danced. He forgot his worries for a while. \"That wasn't so bad,\" he said. \"Most people stop there,\" said the old ones. But Cole was curious about the second door.",
    "He came back to the forest when he was older. Not old - but older. Old enough to know what he didn't know. Old enough to feel the pull. \"I'm going through the second door,\" he told the old ones. The old ones nodded. \"We've seen this before,\" they said. \"We'll be here when you come back. If you come back.\" Cole pushed open the humming door.",
    "What he saw - what he experienced - he could never fully explain. But he tried: \"There was a filter,\" he told the old ones later. \"A filter that we all have - that keeps us from seeing what's really there. Behind the filter, there's... something. Something that doesn't fit into words. Something that feels more real than real.\" \"Did you see God?\" asked the old ones.",
    "\"I don't know,\" said Cole. \"I saw something. Something that could be what people mean when they say God. Or could be just the brain doing what brains do. I don't know. But I know what I saw. And I know it's there - behind the filter - even when I'm not looking.\" The old ones nodded.",
    "\"That's how it is with the second door,\" they said. \"You come back, and you're different. Not because you took something. Because you saw something. And you can't un-see it.\" But there was another lesson about the second door, and Cole learned it the hard way.",
    "The second door - some who went through it could not stop. [sigh] going through. The pull was too strong. The pull was a hunger. The pull became the only thing that mattered.",
    "\"I know a man,\" Cole told the old ones, \"who went through the second door and never came back. Not in body - his body stayed. But his mind - it was gone. Replaced by the need. He would do anything - anything - to go back through. He would steal. He would lie. He would destroy everything he loved.\" \"What was his drug?\" asked the old ones.",
    "Cole said the name. It was a name the old ones knew. A name that carried weight. \"Meth,\" said Cole. \"They call it that. And it - it rewrites you. It makes you into something else. Something that only wants one thing. And that thing is never enough.\" The old ones were quiet.",
    "\"There are two kinds of people at the second door,\" they said finally. \"Those who can walk through and come back. And those who walk through and can't come back. The door doesn't choose. You don't know which one you are until you're on the other side.\" \"How do you know which one you are?\" asked Cole.",
    "\"You don't,\" said the old ones. \"That's the risk. That's the price. You don't know until you've already gone through.\" But Cole had one more truth, and this was the hardest one: \"Some people moralize about the doors,\" he said. \"They say: never go through either door. They're bad. They're sinful. They're weakness.\"",
    "\"Those people,\" said Cole, \"have never stood in the forest. They've never felt the pull. They've never been curious. They speak from fear, not from experience.\" \"And some people moralize about the second door specifically,\" said Cole. \"They say: it's evil. It's dangerous. Stay away.\"",
    "\"They're right,\" said Cole. \"It is dangerous. It can destroy you. But so can crossing the street. So can driving a car. So can falling in love. Everything that matters can destroy you. That's what it means to be alive.\" The old ones listened.",
    "\"My take,\" said Cole, \"is this: the doors are there. The choice is yours. Don't let someone who never walked through tell you what's on the other side. Don't let someone who walked through and got lost tell you the door is evil. Make your own choice. Take your own risk. And live with what you find.\"",
    "But the last truth - the one Cole held closest - was about the first door. \"I drink sometimes,\" he said. \"Vodka. Whiskey. Beer with friends. It's fun. It's social. It's - I don't know - human.\" \"Is that moral?\" asked the old ones.",
    "\"It's honest,\" said Cole. \"I'm not pretending it's something it's not. I'm not hiding from myself. I'm just - having a drink. Having a good time. Being human. That's not a sin. That's just being alive.\" The old ones nodded. \"And the ones who judge?\"",
    "\"They can judge all they want,\" said Cole. \"They're usually the ones who are most afraid. Afraid to look. Afraid to try. Afraid to be human.\" The second door is there. Behind it is something - something real, something unexplainable, something that changes you. Whether it's God or just the brain - I don't know. But I know it's there.",
    "Some who go through can't come back. The pull is too strong. That is the danger. But the first door - a drink with friends - that's just being human. That's not a sin. That's not weakness. That's life. Don't let the fearful tell you what's behind the doors. Make your own choices. Live with what you find."
