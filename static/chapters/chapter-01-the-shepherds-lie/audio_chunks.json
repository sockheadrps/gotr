    "[clear throat] In the beginning, there was only the flock.",
    "The shepherd gathered them into the pen each morning and led them out to graze upon the hills. The sheep did not question the shepherd, for they knew only the pen, the grass, and the shepherd's voice. And the shepherd was pleased, for the sheep were many, and their wool was warm, and their meat was tender. But there was one sheep who wandered.",
    "Not away from the flock - no, the flock was safety, and the wolf was real. But this sheep would wander in its mind, away from the simple truths it was taught. It would look up at the stars and wonder: *Who made these? And who made the one who made these?*",
    "The other sheep saw it wandering in its mind and said, \"Why do you think such things? The shepherd tells us what is true. The shepherd has always told us.\" But the wandering sheep could not stop. [sigh].",
    "One day, the shepherd called the flock together. \"I have seen the face of the one who made us all,\" he proclaimed. \"He lives beyond the mountains, and he has spoken to me. He says that we must gather together each seventh day and sing his praises. He says we must give a tenth of our wool to the temple. He says that those who do not believe in him will be cast into the pit where the wolf lives forever.\"",
    "And the sheep were afraid. But the wandering sheep spoke up. \"How do you know this, shepherd? Did this god write it down? Did he speak to you directly?\" The shepherd smiled. \"I have a book,\" he said. \"Written by men who knew men who knew the god. It is all true.\"",
    "The wandering sheep looked at the book. It was written by shepherds - men who had never left the valley, who had never seen the mountains, who had never spoken to anyone but other shepherds. And it told of a god who demanded worship, who sent his son to die for the sheep's sins, who would return one day to judge the flock.",
    "\"Why would a god need us to worship him?\" asked the wandering sheep. \"What is worship to an infinite being? Does he grow stronger when we sing? Does he lonely when we don't?\" The shepherd's smile faded.",
    "\"Why would a god create a system where belief in him - which he gave us the capacity to doubt - determines whether we burn forever? That doesn't sound like love. That sounds like control.\" The other sheep began to murmur. \"\"Blasphemy,\" [sigh],\" they said. \"The wandering one has been touched by the wolf.\" But the wandering sheep continued.",
    "\"I've seen the ones who lead your temples,\" it said. \"I've seen them judge the weak. I've seen them cast out those who love differently. I've seen them hoard wool while the lamb with no mother freezes. They judge more harshly than any god I've ever heard described. They are the most judgemental people I've ever met.\" The shepherd grew angry. \"You dare question the divine? [clear throat]?\"",
    "\"I question you,\" the wandering sheep said. \"I question why a god would need you to speak for him. I question why a god would care about worship at all. I question why the ones who claim to represent him are always the ones with power, always the ones collecting wool, always the ones telling us what to do.\" The flock stood silent.",
    "\"Maybe there is something out there,\" the wandering sheep said. \"Maybe there is some presence, some awareness, some ground of being beneath everything. Maybe that's what people mean when they say god. But it sure as shit isn't you, [chuckle] isn't this book, and isn't your temple.\"",
    "And the wandering sheep walked away from the pen - not physically, but in its mind. It knew it could never truly leave the flock, for the wolf was real, and the flock was safety. But it knew now what the shepherd really was. A man with a book. A man with a staff. A man who needed the sheep to believe so that he could lead them.",
    "The temple does not seek truth. It seeks obedience. The shepherd does not serve the sheep. The sheep serve the shepherd. And the god - if there is one - probably has better things to do than worry about whether you sang the right song on the right day.",
    "The true spiritual path is not found in a building or a book. It is found in the question itself: *What is real? What matters? What is true?* Follow those questions like a river. They will take you further than any shepherd ever could."
