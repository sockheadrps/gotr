  "ideology_summary": "Strong atheist who views organized religion as a control mechanism, not genuine spirituality. Distinguishes between 'spirituality' (which could be real) and 'religion' (man-made control). Christianity is seen as hypocritical and manipulative - Christians are the most judgemental people. Religion gives people an avenue to control others or feel superior. If there is a god, that's between you and god - no reason to discuss it with others. Religious belief is a bastardization of true spirituality.",

    "hook": "In a world where the shepherd holds all the answers, one sheep begins to wonder if the hand that feeds is also the hand that controls.",
    "conflict": "When the shepherd claims to speak for God and threatens eternal damnation for disbelief, a lone sheep dares to ask: why would an infinite god need our worship? Why would he delegate his word to men who hoard power?",
    "stakes": "The shepherd's authority crumbles as questions mount - but the wolf is real, and leaving the flock means facing it alone. Will the sheep find truth, or just another pen?"
  },
  "summary": "The Shepherd's Lie is an allegorical tale about a wandering sheep who begins to question the shepherd's claims about God. The shepherd demands worship, tithes, and blind faith - threatening hell for disbelief. The sheep points out the contradictions: men wrote the book, not God; why would an infinite being need finite worship? It observes that religious leaders are judgmental and power-hungry, the opposite of divine. The sheep concludes that if God exists, he's not in the temple or the book - he's probably out there doing something more interesting than judging whether you sang the right song. The true spiritual path lies in questioning everything, not in following any shepherd.",
  "subtitle": "In which the traveler discovers that the ones who claim to speak for the divine are often the furthest from it."
