# Chapter 10: The Line and the Leash

*In which the traveler learns the herd follows the line, but the person can step out.*

---

[clear throat] I saw a line that never ended.

It wrapped around a building labeled “Corporate.” The people in the line held papers and rehearsed answers. They were terrified of saying the wrong thing to a clerk who didn’t care about them.

Inside, the clerks asked dumb questions to waste time. “Have you ever smoked weed?” The clerk wanted you to confess on record, not because it mattered, but because it proved they owned the room. The boomers in charge are dying out; most younger generations are fine with pot. So why ask? Because the line is a leash and the question is a tug.

I hate how entitled corporate business is. I hate the way it treats people like a file instead of a life. The line was full of good people bending their backs to a machine that would never love them.

And yet — people keep lining up. They follow the herd. They follow the trends. They follow the loudest voice on the screen. It’s easier to be told what to think than to think. The herd is safe until it isn’t.

I told the traveler: most people are conformist. That’s not an insult. That’s gravity. If you let it, the line will pull you into a life you didn’t choose. The leash will tighten and call it culture.

But there are still people worth knowing. You just have to find them. They’re the ones who can step out of the line and still stand straight. They don’t bow to the clerk. They don’t worship the trend. They look you in the eye and tell the truth.

The herd calls them difficult. The clerk calls them uncooperative. The machine calls them a problem. But the machine doesn’t get to define what a person is.

So I told the traveler: don’t confuse the line with the path. The line is a ritual. The path is a choice. The line keeps you safe but small. The path makes you responsible but real.

You can walk away from the clerk. You can lie to the clerk. You can refuse the clerk. It’s a retail job, not a divine trial. The clerk’s power is only as big as the fear you give it.

That’s the paradox of society. The herd makes the line. The line makes the herd. But one person stepping out breaks the shape. One person saying “no” creates space for another.

So I’m cynical about the herd. I think most people will follow. But I’m hopeful about individuals. Because I’ve seen someone step out and stay out. I’ve seen someone tell the clerk to fuck off and still build a life.

[clear throat] The line will always be there. The leash will always be there. The question is whether you will stand in it.
