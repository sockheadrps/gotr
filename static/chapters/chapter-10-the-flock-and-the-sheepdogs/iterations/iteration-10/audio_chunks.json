    "Chapter 10: The Line and the Leash",
    "[clear throat] I saw a line that never ended. It wrapped around a building labeled ‘Corporate.’ People held papers and rehearsed answers, terrified of saying the wrong thing to a clerk who didn’t care about them.",
    "Inside, the clerks asked dumb questions to waste time. ‘Have you ever smoked weed?’ They wanted a confession, not because it mattered, but because it proved they owned the room.",
    "I hate how entitled corporate business is. I hate the way it treats people like a file instead of a life. The line was full of good people bending their backs to a machine that would never love them.",
    "The herd follows because it’s easier to be told what to think than to think. The line is a leash and the question is a tug. The boomers are dying out, yet the ritual stays.",
    "[sigh] I told the traveler: most people are conformist. That’s gravity. If you let it, the line will pull you into a life you didn’t choose and call it culture.",
    "But there are people worth knowing. They step out of the line and still stand straight. The herd calls them difficult. The clerk calls them uncooperative. The machine calls them a problem.",
    "Don’t confuse the line with the path. The line is a ritual. The path is a choice. The clerk’s power is only as big as the fear you give it.",
    "[clear throat] One person stepping out breaks the shape. The line will always be there. The question is whether you will stand in it."
