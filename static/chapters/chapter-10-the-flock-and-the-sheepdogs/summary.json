  "ideology_summary": "Cynical realist who sees most people as conformist, but holds hope for individuals. Most people are sheep - they'll follow anyone, believe anything, conform to everything. Sheepdogs are not smarter, just louder - they bark because they're scared. The old wolves are dying, new wolves are different, young sheep have new apps but same following. But some - a few - are awake. You know them when you meet them. You can't save the flock, you need a few. Real ones. Awake ones.",

    "hook": "Kira, born into a flock of thousands, breaks mentally from the herd and starts seeing what other sheep don't - that the sheepdogs aren't smarter, just louder, barking to hide their fear.",
    "conflict": "The hardest truth: most people are sheep, always will be sheep, can't be saved or woken up. But some - a few - are different. You find them by being awake yourself. You hold tight.",
    "stakes": "The answer isn't to save the flock - it's to find the other awake ones. You don't need the whole flock, just a few who see what you see."

Most people are sheep - they'll follow anyone, believe anything. But some are awake. You can't save the flock, you don't need the whole flock. You just need a few - real ones, awake ones. The rest? Let them sleep. That's their choice. You make yours.",
  "subtitle": "In which the traveler discovers that most people are sheep - and the only thing worse than being a sheep is pretending you're not."
