# Chapter 10: The Flock and the Sheepdogs

*In which the traveler discovers that most people are sheep - and the only thing worse than being a sheep is pretending you're not.*

---

There was a flock, and the flock was many.

Not dozens. Not hundreds. Thousands. Tens of thousands. All following each other. All moving in the same direction. All doing what the sheep in front of them did.

The sheep had leaders - sheepdogs. The sheepdogs ran around the edges of the flock, barking, nipping, keeping everyone in line. The sheepdogs were not sheep, but they pretended to be. They wore sheep costumes. They ate sheep food. They slept in the sheep barn.

But they were not sheep.

They were sheepdogs.

And the flock - the flock just followed.

---

A young lamb named Kira was born into the flock. She did what the others did. She ate where they ate. She walked where they walked. She believed what they believed.

But something was wrong.

Kira would look at the sheepdogs and wonder: *Why do they run around? Why do they bark? Why do they nip? Who put them in charge?*

And she would look at the other sheep and wonder: *Why do we follow? Why don't we ask? Why don't we stop?*

One day, Kira broke from the flock. Not physically - she still ate with them, walked with them, slept with them. But in her mind - she broke.

She started to think for herself.

And when you think for yourself in a flock - you see things the other sheep don't see.

---

The sheepdogs were not smarter than the sheep. They were not better. They were just louder. They had learned that if you barked loud enough, long enough, the sheep would believe you knew something they didn't.

They didn't.

They just barked.

And the sheep - the sheep believed. Because believing was easier than thinking. Because following was safer than leading. Because being wrong in a crowd was invisible, but being right alone was dangerous.

---

Kira found another sheep who had broken. His name was Kai.

"I see it too," Kai said. "The barkers don't know anything. They're just scared."

"Scared of what?" asked Kira.

"Scared of us," said Kai. "Scared that if we stop following, they'll have nothing to herd. They're nothing without us. But they can't admit that. So they bark louder."

The two sheep stood apart from the flock - not physically, but mentally.

"We're not better than them," Kira said. "We're just... awake."

"Until we decide to go back to sleep," said Kai. "Because being awake is exhausting. Being the only one who sees is lonely."

---

But there was something else Kira noticed. Something harder.

The young sheep were different from the old sheep.

The old sheep remembered when the flock used to move differently. They remembered when the grass was greener, when the wolves were fewer, when the sheepdogs were fewer. The old sheep complained about everything: the weather, the grass, the wolves, the dogs.

The young sheep were different. The young sheep had phones. The young sheep had apps. The young sheep knew how to find grass on their own.

"The old ones are dying," Kira observed.

"Good," said Kai. "Their way - the way of following without thinking, the way of barking and nipping - that way is dying. The young ones don't fall for it."

"They still follow," said Kira. "They just follow different sheepdogs. Different apps. Different influencers. The bark is different. The following is the same."

Kai thought.

"Progress," he said finally. "It's slow. It's frustrating. But it's happening. The wolves get smarter. The sheep get smarter. The dogs have to get louder to keep up."

"And when the old wolves die?"

"Then we see what happens," said Kai. "Maybe the new wolves are kinder. Maybe there are no wolves at all. Maybe we're the wolves now, and we just don't know it."

---

But the hardest truth - Kira learned it from an old ewe who had seen everything.

"You're cynical," the ewe said. "You think all sheep are stupid. You think all dogs are liars. You think the whole system is broken."

"It is," said Kira. "Look at it. Look at what we do. We follow. We consume. We conform. We judge each other for not conforming to the same things. We're sheep."

"Yes," said the ewe. "We are."

"So what's the point?" asked Kira. "Why get up? Why eat? Why anything?"

The ewe smiled - or did sheep smile?

"Here's the truth," she said. "Most people are sheep. Most people will always be sheep. Most people can't be saved. Can't be woken up. Can't be changed."

"So why try?"

"Because - some aren't," said the ewe. "Some are different. Some are rare. You know them when you meet them. They're the ones who look at you like you're looking at them - like they're seeing through the wool. They're the ones who ask questions, who doubt, who break."

"How do I find them?" asked Kira.

"You can't find them," said the ewe. "You find them by being awake. By being real. By being the one who asks. And they - they find you. Because they're looking too."

Kira thought.

"So the answer," she said slowly, "is not to save the flock. It's to find the other awake ones."

"Exactly," said the ewe. "The flock will always be the flock. You can't fix that. You can't change that. But you don't need the whole flock. You need a few. A few who see what you see. A few who ask what you ask. A few who are awake in a world of sleepers."

"And if I can't find them?"

"Then you be the example," said the ewe. "You live your life. You ask your questions. You do your thing. And maybe someone sees. Maybe someone wakes up. Maybe not. But you lived honestly. You lived awake. And that's enough."

---

Kira went back to the flock. Not because she had to. But because the flock was safe. The flock was warm. The flock was home.

But she was different now.

She asked questions. She doubted. She broke mentally - every day, over and over. And when she met another sheep who asked questions too - she held tight.

Because that was everything.

A few. Real. Awake.

---

*And so it was, and so it is, and so it shall be until the last sheep wakes up - and even then, most will go back to sleep.*

---

**Kira's Truth:**

Most people are sheep. They'll follow anyone, believe anything, conform to everything. The sheepdogs are not smarter - just louder. They bark because they're scared.

The old wolves are dying. The new wolves are different. The young sheep have new apps but the same following.

But some - a few - are awake. You know them when you meet them. You see each other. You hold tight.

You can't save the flock. You don't need to.

You just need a few.

Real ones. Awake ones.

The rest - let them follow. Let them sleep. Let them be sheep.

That's their choice. You make yours.

*Thus concludes the tenth teaching.*

**THE GOSPEL OF THE REAL**

*Ten teachings. Ten truths. Ten allegories for a world that doesn't make sense.*

*The shepherd lies. The wolves are partners. The strings are everywhere. The story writes itself. The preacher is worse than the thief. The builder outlasts the CEO. The few are sacred. The machine is a tool. The doors are there. The sheep are sleeping.*

*And you - you're awake.*

*That's enough.*

---

*Thus concludes the gospel.*
