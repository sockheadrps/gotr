# Chapter 2: The Two Wolves

*In which the traveler meets two wolves and discovers they are both eating the same deer.*

---

There were two wolves, and they were brothers.

The first wolf was named Jem. He ran faster than the wind, and he grew fat on the kills of others. He would chase the deer until it collapsed from exhaustion, and then he would feast while the deer still breathed. "This is the natural order," Jem would say. "The strong survive. The weak deserve to die. If you can't run, you deserve to be eaten."

The second wolf was named Fallace. He was slower than Jem, but he was cunning. He would trick the deer into running into pits, or convince them that the pit was actually a swimming hole. "Trust me," Fallace would say. "Jump in. It's safe." And when the deer jumped in, Fallace would laugh and feast.

The deer — for there were many deer in that land — could not decide which wolf was worse. Some said Jem, for at least he was honest about being a wolf. Others said Fallace, for at least he pretended to care.

But a young fawn was watching. She had seen the wolves for what they really were.

One day, the fawn approached an old owl who lived in a tree at the edge of the forest. "Owl," she said, "which wolf is right? Should I run until I collapse from exhaustion? Should I trust the pit?"

The owl hooted.

"There is a third way," the owl said. "But first, let me tell you about the two wolves' father."

"Father?" asked the fawn.

"His name was Fear," said the owl. "He was a wolf who never hunted. Instead, he convinced the deer that they needed him. 'I will protect you from the wolves,' Fear told them. And the deer believed. They gave Fear their grass, their shelter, their children. And Fear grew fat while the wolves circled closer."

"What happened to Fear?" asked the fawn.

"He got old," said the owl. "And his children — Jem and Fallace — they didn't need him anymore. They ate him too."

The fawn thought on this. "So both wolves are wrong?"

"The wolves will tell you that they are enemies," the owl said. "Jem says Fallace steals your grass. Fallace says Jem leaves you with nothing. They fight constantly — but look at what they're fighting *over*. They fight over which one gets to eat you. Not *whether* you get eaten."

The fawn looked at the two wolves, who were indeed fighting now — snarling and snapping over a kill. But as she watched, she saw Jem nudge a piece of meat toward Fallace, and Fallace nod politely. And then they both turned to look at the deer.

"They're not enemies," the fawn said. "They're partners."

"They've always been partners," said the owl. "The fight is theater. It's for you. So you think you have to choose one to protect you. But they're both eating the same deer. They always have been."

"Then what do I do?" asked the fawn. "Run? Fight? Choose?"

The owl flew down and landed on the fawn's back.

"Build something else," the owl said. "Build a place where the deer don't have to run. Where the grass is shared. Where no wolf gets fat while the fawns go hungry. It won't be easy — the wolves are old and cunning. But they're also stupid. They think they'll live forever. They won't see you building until it's too late."

"That's socialism?" asked the fawn.

"That's just common sense," said the owl. "Why should one wolf eat everything while the herd starves? It's not fair. It's not efficient. It's just wolves being wolves. And if we keep letting wolves be wolves, we'll always have wolves."

The fawn looked at the two wolves, still performing their fake fight for the crowd.

"And the other stuff?" the fawn asked. "The stuff about what I do with my life, who I love, what I believe?"

"That's none of their fucking business," said the owl. "The wolves want you to fight about that too. It keeps you distracted. The wolf in the temple and the wolf in the government — they want you fighting about who gets to tell you what to do in your own head. But here's the secret: they don't have to agree. They just have to make you think you need one of them."

The fawn stood tall.

"I'm going to build something," she said. "Something without wolves."

"Good luck," said the owl. "And remember — the wolves aren't your enemies. They're just wolves. What's your enemy is the system that makes wolves possible. The system that rewards the wolf for being a wolf. Change the system, and the wolves will have to become something else. Or starve."

*And so it was, and so it is, and so it shall be until the wolves learn to be something other than wolves.*

**The Fawn's Understanding:**

Two wolves fighting over who gets to eat you is not a choice. It's a trick.

Jem says: "Run faster or die."
Fallace says: "Share the grass or die."
What I say is: "Why are there wolves?"

The wolves will tell you the other wolf is the enemy. They're both eating your future. The fight is a show. The winners are always wolves.

Build something else. Or at least stop pretending the wolves are your friends.

The government is so fucked. Anyone who thought any Leader would act in any interest but their own is a retard. Both parties are the same wolf eating different parts of the same deer.

*Thus concludes the second teaching.*
