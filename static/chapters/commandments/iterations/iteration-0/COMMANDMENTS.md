# The 10 Commandments of the Real

---

**I. QUESTION THE SHEPHERDS**

The temple does not seek truth — it seeks obedience. If there is a god, that's between you and god. Follow the questions, not the ones who claim to have the answers.

---

**II. TRUST NO WOLVES**

Two wolves fighting over who gets to eat you is not a choice — it's a trick. They're partners, not enemies. Build something else.

---

**III. SEE THE STRINGS**

The strings are there. The question is whether you want to look. The only freedom is in seeing the machine for what it is.

---

**IV. WRITE YOUR OWN STORY**

The meaning of life is not found — it is made. Every choice is a page appearing where there was blankness. The meaning is the making.

---

**V. CAUSE NO HARM**

Morality is not a set of rules — it's a question: does this cause harm? And loyalty is the only virtue that matters.

---

**VI. BUILD WITH YOUR HANDS**

The hands know things the head never learns. Watch what they do, not what they say. The thing you build will outlast them.

---

**VII. CHOOSE FEW, CHOOSE REAL**

A hundred acquaintances won't hold you when you fall. Four will. Save your realness for those who deserve it.

---

**VIII. FAIL FORWARD**

You learn by building, not by reading. The machine is a tool — a hammer that becomes whatever you build with it. The building is the point.

---

**IX. CHOOSE YOUR OWN DOORS**

The second door is there — behind it is something real. A drink with friends is just being human. Don't let the fearful tell you what's behind the doors.

---

**X. SEEK THE AWAKE ONES**

Most people are sheep. You can't save the flock — you don't need to. You just need a few. Real ones. Awake ones.

*Thus concludes the commandments.*
