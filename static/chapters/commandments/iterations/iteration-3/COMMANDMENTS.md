# The 10 Commandments of the Unmasked

---

**I. KEEP GOD BETWEEN YOU AND GOD**

If there is a god, that’s between you and fucking god. No temple, priest, or book gets to stand in the middle.

---

**II. MASTER THE MACHINE**

A tool is a tool. Build with it or it builds you. The point isn’t the machine — it’s what you make.

---

**III. REJECT THE RIGGED ARENA**

The market as‑built has to go and be replaced with something more communal. The arena is rigged; build something else.

---

**IV. SEE THE STRINGS**

It’s fucking weird to be a live, sentient being with at least the illusion of free will. Look for the strings anyway — that’s the only freedom that matters.

---

**V. WRITE THE PAGE**

The meaning of life isn’t found — it’s made. The story writes itself, but your choices are the blank pages.

---

**VI. TRUST THE HANDS**

The hands know what the clipboard forgets. If it causes harm, it isn’t holy — it’s just harm.

---

**VII. REFUSE THE LEASH**

Don’t let a leash speak for you. Say it plain, or say nothing at all.

---

**VIII. OWE NOBODY YOUR BELIEFS**

I don’t owe you shit, so don’t bother me with your beliefs. Don’t force people to watch your theater.

---

**IX. CHOOSE THE REAL ONES**

The friends you love are real ass fucking people you wouldn’t change a single thing about. Choose few. Choose real.

---

**X. OWN YOUR WRONG**

Everyone’s wrong sometimes. It’s fine to be wrong and believe you were right, then find out you weren’t. That honesty is the difference.

*Thus concludes the commandments.*
