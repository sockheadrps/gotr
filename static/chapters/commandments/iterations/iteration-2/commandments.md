# The 10 Commandments of the Unillusioned

---

**I. KEEP GOD BETWEEN YOU AND GOD**

If there is a god, that’s between you and fucking god. No temple, priest, or book gets to stand in the middle.

---

**II. NAME THE CONTROL**

Organized religion is the single most fuckign retarded thing humans have ever done. The temple doesn’t seek truth — it seeks obedience.

---

**III. REJECT THE RIGGED ARENA**

Capitalism has to go and be replaced with a way more socialist/communist type market. The arena is rigged; build something else.

---

**IV. SEE THE STRINGS**

It’s fucking weird to be a live, sentient being with at least the illusion of free will. Look for the strings anyway — that’s the only freedom that matters.

---

**V. WRITE THE PAGE**

The meaning of life isn’t found — it’s made. The story writes itself, but your choices are the blank pages.

---

**VI. MEASURE BY HARM**

Morality isn’t rules. It’s a question: does this cause harm? If it does, don’t dress it up with sermons.

---

**VII. SPEAK PLAINLY, NOT HOLY**

Preaching isn’t purity. Admit when you’re wrong instead of hiding behind righteousness.

---

**VIII. OWE NOBODY YOUR BELIEFS**

I don’t owe you shit, so don’t bother me with your beliefs. Don’t force people to watch your theater.

---

**IX. CHOOSE THE REAL ONES**

The friends you love are real ass fucking people you wouldn’t change a single thing about. Choose few. Choose real.

---

**X. BE WILLING TO BE WRONG**

Everyone’s wrong sometimes. It’s fine to be wrong and believe you were right, then find out you weren’t. That’s how you grow.

---

*Thus concludes the commandments.*
