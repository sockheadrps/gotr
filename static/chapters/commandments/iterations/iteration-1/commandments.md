# The 10 Commandments of the Unbought

---

**I. KEEP GOD BETWEEN YOU AND GOD**

If there is a god, that’s between you and fucking god. No priest, temple, or book gets to stand in the middle.

---

**II. NAME THE CONTROL**

Organized religion is the single most fuckign retarded thing humans have ever done. The temple doesn’t seek truth — it seeks obedience.

---

**III. DO NOT WORSHIP THE ARENA**

Capitalism has to go. The arena is rigged, the teams are costumes, and the empire eats either way. Build something else.

---

**IV. SEE THE STRINGS**

It’s fucking weird to be a live, sentient being with at least the illusion of free will. Look for the strings anyway — that’s the only freedom that matters.

---

**V. WRITE THE PAGE**

The meaning of life isn’t found — it’s made. The story writes itself, but your choices are the blank pages.

---

**VI. MEASURE BY HARM**

Morality isn’t rules. It’s a question: does this cause harm? If it does, don’t dress it up with sermons.

---

**VII. PREACHING ISN’T PURITY**

The loudest preacher usually has the most to hide. If you do wrong, admit it — don’t sell holiness while you steal.

---

**VIII. OWE NOBODY YOUR BELIEFS**

I don’t owe you shit, so don’t bother me with your beliefs. Don’t force people to watch your theater.

---

**IX. CHOOSE THE REAL ONES**

The friends you love are real ass fucking people you wouldn’t change a single thing about. Choose few. Choose real.

---

**X. BE WILLING TO BE WRONG**

Everyone’s wrong sometimes. It’s fine to be wrong and believe you were right, then find out you weren’t. That’s how you grow.

---

*Thus concludes the commandments.*
