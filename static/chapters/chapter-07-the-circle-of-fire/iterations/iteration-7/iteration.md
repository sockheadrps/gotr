# Chapter 7: The Small Fire

*In which the traveler learns a few real flames beat a thousand candles.*

---

[clear throat] I once walked through a city of lanterns.

There were lights everywhere — windows glowing, signs blinking, streets lit like a festival. People waved from every doorway and called it community. But when the wind blew, most of those lights went out.

Outside the city, I found a small fire in a clearing. Four people sat around it. They weren’t loud. They weren’t many. But the fire held.

I asked why they didn’t come into the city. One of them said, “Because the lights in there are pretty, but they don’t warm you.”

I understood. I can name on one hand the people I feel that way about. We meet fucking tons of people, but the ones you truly cherish? You can count them on a hand. That’s how rare it is.

The city tried to shame them. “You’re isolating.” “You’re missing out.” “You need more friends.” The circle just looked at the fire and shrugged. They didn’t need more. They needed real.

I asked how the fire got built. One of them said, “Struggle.”

I hate that struggle exists. But I’m glad the people around me had to struggle those things, because that struggle made them real ass fucking people. The kind you don’t want to change a single thing about. Without that shitty ass fucking shit that happened to us, we wouldn’t be who we are. I wouldn’t be who I am. That’s not romantic. That’s just the math of it.

I’ve gotten drunk and told my people I love them and felt stupid for saying it. But it’s true. I’m lucky as fuck I got to meet the few I have. I can count them on one hand, and that’s not a tragedy — that’s a miracle. You meet tons of people. You only meet a few that feel like home.

The city calls struggle a failure. The circle calls it a forge. I’m not saying you should chase pain. I’m saying when it comes, it leaves a mark that can turn strangers into kin.

I told the traveler: you don’t need a crowd. You need a few people who will sit with you in the cold and not flinch. People who will tell you the truth even when it stings. People who will carry your name when you’re not in the room.

The city lights promise warmth but sell loneliness. The small fire gives less light but more heat. That’s the trade.

People ask why I’m loyal. Because I know how rare it is. Because I’ve seen the city. Because I’ve seen what happens when the wind hits all those candles at once.

So I build a fire with the people who matter. And I feed it. That means time. That means honesty. That means showing up when it’s not convenient. That means forgiveness when it’s earned and distance when it’s not.

The traveler looked at the small fire and asked, “Is that all?”

I said, “That’s more than most people ever get.”

The city kept flashing. The circle kept burning.

[clear throat] If you find a real flame, guard it.
