    "Chapter 7: The Circle of Fire",
    "[clear throat] There was a man who walked many roads. And on those roads, he met thousands. Tens of thousands.",
    "Names passed through him like wind through branches — remembered briefly, then gone. And the man thought: Am I alone?",
    "For he saw others walking in packs. Hundreds, walking together. Laughing. Shouting. Filling the air with noise.",
    "One night, by a fire that crackled and popped beneath stars, the man sat with three others. Four. That was all.",
    "Let me tell you about the difference between a hundred friends and four.",
    "See that flame? It burns hot. But if I took that same fire and spread it across a hundred campsites — nothing would catch.",
    "But this fire — this one fire — it knows us. It has burned with us through storms.",
    "When one of us stumbled, the others pulled them back to the warmth.",
    "[sigh] I met thousands. I laughed with them, drank with them, worked beside them. But when I fell — really fell — who reached down?",
    "Four. I can count on ONE HAND the people I'd take a bullet for.",
    "That's not many. But each one of them is worth more than a thousand.",
    "Because when you're sitting in the dark at 4 AM — it's not the thousand that show up. It's the four.",
    "Because being real is hard. You can't do it with everybody.",
    "That's exhausting to be around. So I found people who don't do that. People who are actually WITH you. Just... there. Real.",
    "Finding those people — man, it's rare. I've walked a lot of roads and I can count them on one hand.",
    "You don't need many. What you want is a few who are REAL. And when you find them — you hold on tight.",
    "[chuckle] Struggle builds us. That's what forges the bond. With the fire, we're family. Not by blood. Just by choice. We CHOSE."

    "A hundred acquaintances won't hold you when you fall. Four will.",
    "I can name on ONE HAND the people I'd take a bullet for.",
    "Being real is rare, and it exhausts you — save it for those who deserve it.",
    "Struggle together builds bonds that nothing else can.",
    "Hold tight to the ones who stayed. They are worth more than you know.",
    "Thus concludes the seventh teaching."
