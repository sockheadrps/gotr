  "ideology_summary": "Existential pragmatist who focuses on practical living over philosophical pontificating. Doesn't spend much time worrying about the meaning of life - focuses on tangible things you can control and direct experience. Death is the end - no afterlife. Time only exists now; when you die, it's all gone. Meaning is not found, it's made. The book was never written - it writes itself. Every choice is a page appearing where there was blankness.",

    "hook": "A warrior named Mira discovers the book containing her life was never written - the pages simply appear, one after another, with no author and no plan.",
    "conflict": "Mira learns her brother's death was scripted - she had no choice. But her choice to avenge him was different: it was the story writing itself through her, creating new pages where there were none. Yet the book is ending - only a few pages remain.",
    "stakes": "When the book closes, it's over - no afterlife, no continuation. But the ending isn't sad: it's honest. The meaning isn't in the story's conclusion, it's in the writing itself."

  "summary": "The Story That Wasn't Written follows Mira, a warrior who discovers her life was never authored - the book writes itself. Some things are scripted (her brother's death), but her choices create new blank pages. An old woman named Vera reveals the secret: meaning isn't found in the book, it's made by the characters filling the pages. Death is the end - when you die, it's all gone. But that's what makes every moment precious: the pages are numbered and finite. The meaning is the making.",
  "subtitle": "In which the traveler discovers that the story has no author - and that's the point."
