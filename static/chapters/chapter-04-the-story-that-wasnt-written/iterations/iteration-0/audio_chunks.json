    "Chapter 4: The Story That Wasn't Written",
    "[clear throat] There was a book, and the book had pages. On every page, there was a story. Heroes and villains, victories and defeats.",
    "But there was a problem. The book had never been written. The stories just appeared. Page after page, like frost on a window.",
    "One character — a young warrior named Mira — noticed first. Who wrote my story? The page did not answer.",
    "But there must be someone who decided I would be born, that I would learn to fight, that I would lose my brother.",
    "Mira turned to the next page. She read ahead — pages and pages of her future. Am I doomed to live this exact story?",
    "[sigh] In another part of the book, there was a philosopher named Soren. Here's what I've learned.",
    "Every page appears at the moment it's needed. The story doesn't know what comes next until it writes itself. There is no plan. There is no author.",
    "That's just randomness. Or is randomness the only true kind of meaning?",
    "The things that are truly chosen — not planned, not written, not predetermined — those are the only things that matter.",
    "So my brother dying was written? It was written. You had no choice. And my choosing to avenge him? That was you. That was the story writing itself through you.",
    "At the end of the book, an old woman named Vera spoke. You're asking the wrong questions.",
    "What is the meaning of my life? As if meaning is something to be found. There are only a few pages left. Then the book ends.",
    "[chuckle] Everything matters because it ends. Every word is precious because there are only so many words.",
    "Here's the secret: There is no meaning. There never was. Meaning is something the characters put in themselves. You are the meaning. You write yourself.",
    "Mira stood at the edge of the book. One day, soon, the book would close. But until then — there were pages to fill. Choices to make. A story to write.",
    "Maybe that was enough. Maybe that was everything."

    "The meaning of life is not found. It is made.",
    "The book was never written — it writes itself. Every choice you make is a page appearing where there was blankness.",
    "When you die, it's all gone. That's the only time time stops.",
    "Everything matters because it ends. The meaning is the making. The end is the only truth. So make something.",
    "Thus concludes the fourth teaching."
