# Chapter 4: The Lamp That Went Dark

*In which the traveler learns the light is temporary and still worth tending.*

[clear throat] I once met a man who kept a lamp in a window.

Every night he lit it. Every morning it went dark. The village asked why. “Because it’s night,” he said. “Because it’s morning.” He didn’t argue about the meaning of the lamp. He just lit it.

A traveler came and asked him, “What is the purpose of that flame?”

The man shrugged. “It keeps my hands from bumping into the table.”

The traveler wanted a bigger answer. The traveler wanted a book. He wanted a story that was already written.

So I sat the traveler down and told him about time. I told him there is no past or future, it’s just a concept, and everything you experienced has happened right now. The traveler frowned. I told him there is no after. He frowned harder. I told him when you die it’s all gone, that’s the only time time stops.

He said, “That can’t be true. There has to be a reason.”

I said, “Your reasons are a luxury. The lamp still needs oil.”

He wanted to argue about souls and cosmic plans. I told him about brains. I told him that as soon as you die the neuron connections probably deteriorate like super quick. I told him that when the wire breaks, the light goes out. You can pray all you want, but a broken filament is a broken filament.

He looked at the lamp and finally saw the wick. He saw the ash. He saw the small circle of light on the floor and the huge darkness outside the window. He asked, “So what’s the point if the light goes out?”

I said, “The point is the light while it’s on.”

He said, “That feels small.”

I said, “Small is honest.”

The traveler wanted a map. He wanted a path that promised a mountain. I told him the map isn’t written. You draw it while you walk. You don’t wait for meaning to show up. You make the next step worth taking.

You don’t get a gold star for suffering. You don’t get a secret ending for being good. You get right now. You get the people in the room. You get the work in your hands. You get the meal you can taste. You get the lamp in the window.

That’s not nihilism. That’s just practical. It means if you want a better life, you build it. If you want a better world, you build it. Not because a god told you to, but because you’re here and you can.

The traveler still wanted a sign in the sky. He wanted proof that his days were counted by someone else’s hand. I told him the sky doesn’t keep your ledger. The lamp does. The plate does. The call you return does. Meaning lives in the small things you actually touch, not in the myth you keep waiting for.

The traveler asked, “But what about the story?”

I said, “You are the story. And it doesn’t last.”

That scared him. So I told him something else: the flame isn’t big, but it’s real. It doesn’t need to last forever to matter. It doesn’t need a cosmic judge to be worth lighting. The point of the lamp is that it keeps your hands from bumping into the table while you’re here.

I’ve seen people spend their whole lives waiting for a meaning that never arrives. They starve next to a full plate. They ignore the friend in front of them because they’re chasing a voice in the sky. That’s a choice too, and it’s a waste.

So I told the traveler to stop looking for a story that was already written. I told him to write one sentence today. Then another tomorrow. Not a myth. Not a sermon. Just a life you can actually live.

[clear throat] The lamp will go dark. Light it anyway.

**The Wanderer’s Wisdom:**
- There is no after; the light goes out when the wire breaks.
- The only time time stops is when you die.
- Meaning isn’t found. It’s made in the next step.
- Practical living beats empty philosophy every time.
- Light the lamp while you’re here.
