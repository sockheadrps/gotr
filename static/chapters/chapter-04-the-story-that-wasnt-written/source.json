  "the_case": "Let me make the case for existential pragmatist who focuses on practical living over philosophical pontificating.. You don't spend much time worrying about the meaning of life. You tend to focus on tangible things you can control and direct experience rather than abstract philosophy. You acknowledge death is the end with no afterlife.",
